            <p>
                Here's an idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole premise of companies and new-age startups
                relies on possibilities of getting funded by financial institutions
                and individuals at any or many stages of their growth and development. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This has been an age-long practice and applies in many fields of work, 
                including and not limited to engineering, medicine, technology, etc. The 
                model has proven to be successful over the years, and has given us
                great businesses and marvelous institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Great business models also build great billionaires and millionaires. And
                rightly so, because they deserve it owing to all their hard work and perseverence.
                These enterpreneurs and venture capitalists shape the world with their far-fetched
                vision, unique observability and ability to solve problems at scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's the problem though.
