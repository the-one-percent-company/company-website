        <h3>The problem: Capitalism</h3>
        <div class="text-left">
            <p>
                Here's a thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole premise of companies and new-age startups
                relies on possibilities of getting funded by financial institutions
                and individuals at any or many stages of their growth and development.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has been an age-long practice and applies in many fields of work,
                including and not limited to engineering, medicine, technology, etc. The
                model has proven to be successful over the years, and has given us
                great businesses and marvelous institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Great business models also build great billionaires and millionaires. And
                rightly so, because they deserve it owing to all their hard work and perseverence.
                These enterpreneurs and venture capitalists shape the world with their far-fetched
                vision, unique observability and ability to solve problems at scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's the problem though.
            </p>
            <p>
                Great businesses are build with great teams. And teams put their sweat and into
                bringing the founders' vision to fruition. But they aren't paid as much as the people
                at the top, who hold the majority shares in the company. Many a times, these people at
                the top are not even the founders.
            </p>
            <p>
                The owners of businesses sometimes sell away parts of their company to people
                with money to bootstrap, or achieve growth at rocket speed. And the people with money become people with
                more money, while the ones
                whose hard work brings in the money, feed off of salaries that are minute compared to
                who they earn the money for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Businesses in the past were means to solving problems. Businesses in the present are means
                to solving problems and making the rich richer.
                The rich have found ways to make their money while they sip away fancy beachside cocktails
                on vacations, and having the investees work hard for their cash vaults.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although this isn't the case with many well organised businesses, but is definitely
                the case with many others. And I myself hate it to the core.
            </p>
