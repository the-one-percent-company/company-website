            <h3>The problem: Capitalism</h3>
            <div class="text-left">
                <p>
                    Here's a thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole premise of companies and new-age startups
                    relies on possibilities of getting funded by financial institutions
                    and individuals at any or many stages of their growth and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has been an age-long practice and applies in many fields of work,
                    including and not limited to engineering, medicine, technology, etc. The
                    model has proven to be successful over the years, and has given us
                    great businesses and marvelous institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Great business models also build great billionaires and millionaires. And
                    rightly so, because they deserve it owing to all their hard work and perseverence.
                    These enterpreneurs and venture capitalists shape the world with their far-fetched
                    vision, unique observability and ability to solve problems at scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's the problem though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Great businesses are build with great teams. And teams put their sweat and time into
                    bringing the founders' vision to fruition. But they aren't paid as much as the people
                    at the top, the shareholders, who hold the majority shares in the company. Many a times, these people at
                    the top are not even the founders, having gone through multiple rounds of funding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The owners of businesses sometimes sell away parts of their company to people
                    with money to bootstrap, or achieve growth at rocket speed. And the people with money become people
                    with
                    more money, while the teams
                    whose hard work brings in the money, are disposed to salaries that are minute compared to
                    the shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Businesses in the present are means to solving problems and making money to fill in cash vaults.
                    The rich have found ways to make their money while they sip away fancy beachside cocktails
                    on vacations, and having the investees work hard for their cash vaults.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although this isn't the case with many well organised businesses, but is definitely
                    the case with many others.
                </p>
                <p>The current state of employment is that the employees are paid for the time put into work, instead of the impact 
                    created by their work. The time rate of each employee is pre-determined during interviews and the outcome is 
                    the weekly/monthly salary that stays the same and increases gradually with experience. At best, there are employee
                    stock option pools which is a very small sliver of the cake as compared to the investors.

                        The above problem is a little argumentative. For many, it may not even be a problem. If you don't
                        see this as a problem, you're free to leave this website at once, because the rest of content is
                        not for you.

            <h3>The Solution: Anti Capitalism</h3>
            <div class="text-left">
                <p>
                    It's simple. The team deserves the profits that the company makes. 
                </p>
                <p>And the team comprises of everyone.<br/> Founders, developers, investors, designers, sales, operations, customer
                    support. Every ONE!
                </p>
                <p>The question is how is it to be achieved. Although the solution is plain simple, it's implementation can become
                    quite tricky. In an ideal world, every individual should be monetarily compensated for the impact he/she creates
                    in creating company's profits. This can be achieved if there was an way to easily calculate everyone's impact
                    on the organisation's profits. There are ways to do it, and this is what this company's organisational hirerchy is about.
