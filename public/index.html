            <h3>The problem: Capitalism</h3>
            <div class="text-left">
                <p>
                    Here's a thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole premise of companies and new-age startups
                    relies on possibilities of getting funded by financial institutions
                    and individuals at any or many stages of their growth and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has been an age-long practice and applies in many fields of work,
                    including and not limited to engineering, medicine, technology, etc. The
                    model has proven to be successful over the years, and has given us
                    great businesses and marvelous institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Great business models also build great billionaires and millionaires. And
                    rightly so, because they deserve it owing to all their hard work and perseverence.
                    These enterpreneurs and venture capitalists shape the world with their far-fetched
                    vision, unique observability and ability to solve problems at scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's the problem though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Great businesses are build with great teams. And teams put their sweat and time into
                    bringing the founders' vision to fruition. But they aren't paid as much as the people
                    at the top, who hold the majority shares in the company. Many a times, these people at
                    the top are not even the founders, having gone through multiple rounds of funding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The owners of businesses sometimes sell away parts of their company to people
                    with money to bootstrap, or achieve growth at rocket speed. And the people with money become people
                    with
                    more money, while the ones
                    whose hard work brings in the money, feed off of salaries that are minute compared to
                    who they earn the money for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Businesses in the past were means to solving problems. Businesses in the present are means
                    to solving problems and making the rich richer.
                    The rich have found ways to make their money while they sip away fancy beachside cocktails
                    on vacations, and having the investees work hard for their cash vaults.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although this isn't the case with many well organised businesses, but is definitely
                    the case with many others. And I myself hate it to the core.

            <div class="text-left">
                <p>
                    Let me paint you vivid picture of a scenario.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of a person called <b> Mr. Jack TheDoodleDoo.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Jack on one fine day, came across a problem being faced by people in his neighbourhood.
                    The problem could be anything, like having the neighbourhood garbage not being taken care of,
                    or frequent thefts in neighbourhood. The problem doesn't matter much here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Jack, being the awesome problem solver he is being a software engineer, comes up with a
                    tech based solution to the so-called problem. He quickly comes up with a proof of concept for
                    a website/app, launches it and starts spreading the word.
                    Very shortly, his indigenious solution starts getting widespread attention. Little did Jack know,
                    that there were many other neighbourhoods facing the same problem. The app gets immediate adoption
                    in his as well as other neighbourhoods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Jack sees an opportunity here for an idea that could scale at many levels. <i>Eureka!</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to scale this solution, Mr. Jack could incorporate
                    a company, easily get it funded from an Angel, hire a team on salary and get started on an awesome
                    journey of enterpreneurship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, Mr. Jack is a pretty reasonable guy. He understands the accountability that comes with running
                    a company and that the seed investment has to be converted to 2x, 10x, 50x returns and so on. This
                    is
                    pretty normal for a startup, and Mr. Jack could go on this journey. But instead, he comes up with
                    the
                    following model of work:
                </p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h3>The Solution: Anti Capitalism</h3>
            <div class="text-left">
                <p>
                    Mr. Jack lays down all kinds of work to be done for the next 6 months. He classifies the work into
                    different categories and creates some preliminary tasks. Then he begins hiring immediately. 
                    But instead of a steady salary, he offers percentage gains from the company's returns to his hirees.
